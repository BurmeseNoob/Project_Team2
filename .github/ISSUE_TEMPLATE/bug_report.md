### *Issue Description*

* *Merge conflict occurred when attempting to integrate a feature branch into the main branch, preventing the completion of the merge process.*


### *Steps to Reproduce the Issue*

1. *Create a new feature branch from the main branch.*
2. *Make changes to the same file i both the main branch and the feature branch.*
3. *Attempt to merge the feature branch back into the main branch.*
4. *Observe the merge conflict error messages.*


### *Expected Result*

* *The feature branch should merge into the main branch without conflicts, allowing for smooth integration of changes.*


### *Actual Result*

* *The merge process fails, displaying conflict messages and requiring manual resolution of the conflicting changes.*


###  *Additional Details / Screenshot*

* *To minimize future merge conflicts, it is advisable for team members to communicate and coordinate changes, especially when working on the same files.*
* *Regularly pulling the latest changes from the main branch into feature branches can also help to identify and ressolve potential conflicts earlier in the development process.*
